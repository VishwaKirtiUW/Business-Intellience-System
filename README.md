**Objective:** <br>
The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end Business Intelligence System for a manufacturing company that helps in analyzing data and presenting actionable information which helps executives, managers and other corporate end users make informed business decisions 


**Background Information:**<br>
The company manufactures and sells products to make money.The products are grouped into product categories and types for simplicity in stocking, marketing, and otherwise organizing them. Each product has a Price (full retail price, when sold to customers) a Wholesale Price (discounted price, when sold to resellers) and a Cost (the cost to produce the product).  The products are sold either directly to customers or to resellers who will resell them to their own customers.  These product sales happen through different channels (ways of interacting with customers and resellers) and some sales happen though physical stores, while others happen online via the company website.
